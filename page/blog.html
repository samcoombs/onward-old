        With 2020 all but ruled out for international travel, it's an
        understatement to say we're more than ready to hop on a plane as soon as
        travel is possible again. The announcement of the vaccine rollout is
        certainly a reason to celebrate, and while we might have to wait a
        little longer to officially pop the end-of-pandemic champagne, the time
        to think about travel is here. These are the destinations we're keen to
        jet off to as soon as the world opens up!

        Backpacking Cambodia was one of the best experiences I ever had.
      </p>
      <p class="blog__text">
        When I first visited Cambodia, I had low expectations for the country. I
        hadn’t heard much about it. I only knew it’s horrible past and that it
        wasn’t that developed. I didn’t expect much. But, traveling Cambodia, I
        was blown away by how friendly the people were, how beautiful the
        country was, and how much there was to see and do there.
      </p>
      <p class="blog__text">
        Now, Cambodia one of my all-time favorite travel destinations – and I
        think it’s one of the most underrated countries in the world. I can’t
        speak highly enough about it!
